# Infectious Disease Models
Python implementation of common infectious disease transmission models.

A Gallery of infectious disease models for the quick usage in the infectious disease control and prevention.

## Models:
### Compartment Models
These types of models seperate each individual into **states**.
- sir
- seir
- logistic
- seir-caq
- mosquito resistance prediction

## Methods
times series model

### RNN Models
Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) is a class of recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.
